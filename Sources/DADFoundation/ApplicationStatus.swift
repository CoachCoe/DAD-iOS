// when applying; a native request presents that receipt as its bearer (`applicationStatus`).
//
// The receipt can only be created by `applyWithReceipt`, which the contract tags browser-only, so an app
// install has no receipt of its own today and this screen stays hidden until DAD-Main admits that operation
// to the mobile contract. The seam, the model and the screen are complete and tested against the contract.
